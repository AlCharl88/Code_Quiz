# Code_Quiz
This project is an homework assignment from the UConn Bootcamp.

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to create a timer-based code quiz on Javascript fondamentals that stores high scores so that the user can gauge its progress compared to its peers. 

### Procedure
The application start by clicking the start button, and the user is presented with a series of questions related to Javascript. There is a total of 8 questions and each question has multipes choices answer. The number of questions decides the length of time for the quiz (15 seconds/question). If an asnwer to a question is correct, the user is presneted with the next question and so one. If an answer to a question is incorrect, the user is penalized with 10s less in the score. The final score is based on the amount remaining on the timer.

At the end of the quiz (when the user answers all questions or time is up), upon viewing their score, the user is able to enter their Name to add their score to the High Scores list. Once they enter their initials, the scoreboard will appear with an option to clear the board or restart the quiz.

## Challenges
This activity was very challenging. AT the time I submitted the homework, I couldn't figur eout how the have the html div containing the form (#submit-score) hidden during the question-answer, and showed only at the end of the Q&A.
